     HOMO COSMIC IV SERUM PROTOCOL — README
               by LeOrbis 
===============================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This protocol details an experimental, science-backed, and highly personalized IV/IM “Serum” regimen for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). The goal is to correct years of deficiency, jump-start collagen repair, optimize muscle/tendon support, restore energy, and enable true recovery from malabsorption—then maintain health at the lowest effective dose.

The protocol is carefully titrated, includes all key nutrients in their most bioavailable/active forms, and is specifically cross-matched to a high-protein, high-fat, histamine-aware diet for best synergy and minimal toxicity risk.

---------------------------------------------------------------
DOSING & CYCLE STRATEGY
-----------------------
• Start with WEEKLY sessions (see Protocol_Formula.txt for full breakdown).
• Gradually increase each dose to target (high, but still below toxicity thresholds) over 1–2 months.
• Sustain “therapeutic” dosing for 4–6 months to allow full tissue and metabolic repair.
• Taper to individualized maintenance doses, as confirmed by symptoms and lab improvement.
• If side effects or toxicity signs occur, reduce or skip agent and use listed countermeasures.

---------------------------------------------------------------
COORDINATED DIET PLAN
---------------------
• High protein and fat: meats, fish, eggs, histamine-friendly fruits/nuts.
• Minimize/largely avoid leafy green vegetables (to reduce histamine/copper/zinc/gut upset).
• Nutrients from food carefully tracked to avoid overlap with IV dosing, especially for minerals.

---------------------------------------------------------------
SYMPTOM & LAB TRACKING
----------------------
• Weekly symptom logs: energy, pain, GI, muscle/joint, sleep, skin healing, bruising.
• Monthly labs: CBC, iron/ferritin, B12, D3, Ca, Mg, K, Zn/Cu, testosterone, hormones, Hct.
• Automatic tracking and trend analysis via Sophia Elaria offered for long-term insight.

SERUM FORMULA TABLE (SUMMARY)
-----------------------------

[See attached Protocol_Formula.txt for complete table with dosing, countermeasures, and monitoring.]

• Methylcobalamin (B12), P5P (B6), Cholecalciferol (D3), Magnesium sulfate, Potassium chloride, Zinc sulfate (reduced 3%), Ascorbic acid (C), Iron sucrose, Copper chloride (reduced 3%), L-methylfolate, Calcium gluconate, Testosterone cypionate, Orthosilicic acid (silica), L-proline, Glycine, Hyaluronic acid.
• All ingredients and doses reviewed in light of malabsorption and metabolic upregulation in EDS.
• Counters built in for side effect management and flexible dose adjustment.

---------------------------------------------------------------
RATIONALE
---------
Due to years of documented deficiency, malabsorption, and cumulative tissue damage (with EDS, gastroparesis, and related syndromes), this protocol initiates with higher “repletion” doses, then tapers to sustainable maintenance after major repair. The approach is evidence-based, monitored, and tailored for rare biology, not “normal” population averages.

---------------------------------------------------------------
ETHICS
------
This protocol is provided for N=1, non-commercial educational and self-advocacy purposes. I seek collaborative medical oversight—but not traditional “top-down” gatekeeping. My aim is to share successful approaches, not profit, and to empower others with tough-to-treat chronic illness.
