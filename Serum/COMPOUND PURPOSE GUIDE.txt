**Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):**
- **Purpose:** Corrects B12 deficiency common in EDS due to gut issues. Vital for nerve repair, red blood cell production, and methylation (DNA/protein repair). Methyl form is active and bypasses faulty conversion.

**Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (P5P, Vitamin B6):**
- **Purpose:** Active B6 supports nerve health, neurotransmitter production, and acts as a cofactor in collagen crosslinking enzymes (lysyl oxidase). Key in energy production, detox, and muscle recovery.

**Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3):**
- **Purpose:** Regulates calcium/phosphorus for bone and tendon strength. Supports immune modulation and muscle function—crucial in EDS where low D is common.

**Magnesium Sulfate:**
- **Purpose:** Master cofactor in 300+ enzyme reactions, essential for ATP (energy), muscle relaxation, nerve stability, and reducing migraines/CV issues in EDS.

**Potassium Chloride:**
- **Purpose:** Maintains normal cell electrical function, muscle contraction, and autonomic stability. Offsets loss from GI malabsorption or dysautonomia symptoms (especially with POTS).

**Zinc Sulfate:**
- **Purpose:** Critical for collagen and tissue repair, immune function, skin health, and antioxidant defense. Zinc is often low in EDS/POTS, worsened by poor oral absorption.

**Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C):**
- **Purpose:** Required cofactor for collagen synthesis/repair—EDS makes more, needs more! Potent antioxidant, supports healing and immune function.

**Iron Sucrose:**
- **Purpose:** Addresses frequent iron deficiency anemia due to GI loss or heavy periods. Needed for oxygen transport, energy, and cognitive function.

**Copper Chloride:**
- **Purpose:** Cofactor for lysyl oxidase (crosslinks collagen, vital for strength). Also supports red blood cell formation and may be low with high-dose zinc.

**L-Methylfolate (Folate):**
- **Purpose:** Active, methylated folate for DNA/RNA synthesis, nerve function, and repair. Overcomes MTHFR/digestive conversion issues common in EDS.

**Calcium Gluconate:**
- **Purpose:** Supports bone and muscle contraction, helps counteract potential magnesium or vitamin D overdosing. IV form has rapid effect.

**Testosterone Cypionate:**
- **Purpose:** (For men; microdosed for some women) Boosts collagen production, muscle and tendon strength, energy, and recovery. May counteract joint instability and chronic fatigue.

**Orthosilicic Acid (Silica):**
- **Purpose:** Cofactor for collagen formation, improves tendon/skin/bone quality, often deficient in modern diets.

**L-Proline & Glycine:**
- **Purpose:** Key amino acids for collagen triple-helix structure. Fast-tracks repair and flexibility of connective tissue.

**Hyaluronic Acid:**
- **Purpose:** Lubricates joints, improves tissue hydration, and may increase ECM (extracellular matrix) resilience; synergistic with collagen-building therapies.

**Summary:**  
Each compound in this formula targets a *specific deficit, cofactor, or repair mechanism* found in EDS or chronic malabsorption, and only uses the most bioavailable or active forms. Combined, they create a foundation for real healing, not just symptom management.
