Dear Dr. [Name],

My name is LeOrbis, and I am an Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) patient, self-advocate, and bioengineer with medical assistant experience. I am building an integrated therapy protocol for EDS based on published research, current clinical practice, and my observed needs as someone with malabsorption and high metabolic turnover.

This protocol uses IV/IM forms of essential nutrients, electrolytes, and testosterone, along with robust symptom/lab monitoring and countermeasures for potential toxicity. My aim is not to “DIY medicine,” but to work in partnership with an open-minded, innovative provider for safe monitoring and adjustment.

Would you be willing to review my protocol (attached), offer feedback, and consider collaborating to monitor and co-sign for necessary labs, prescriptions, or adjustments?

I believe with proper medical support, this plan could improve function, minimize side effects, and offer new insights for EDS management.

Thank you for your consideration—and for supporting patients seeking to design better futures for rare conditions like ours.

Sincerely,
