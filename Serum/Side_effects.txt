**General Safety Tips:**
- Always start doses low, building up while monitoring symptoms/labs.
- Track new symptoms, side effects, or mood/energy changes DAILY in week 1, and at every dose change.
- Signs of allergic reaction (rash, swelling, trouble breathing), arrhythmia, confusion, or severe pain = GO TO ER / Seek emergency help immediately.
- Labs: CBC, electrolytes, ferritin, vitamins/minerals, liver/kidney, hormones.
- If unsure, consult your doctor and bring this protocol/data to every appointment.

**Note- Grapefuit can cause these to worsen as it causes nutrients to absorb slower**
