EDS OTC Collagen + Cofactor Protocol — For Support & Community Use
(v1.0, Curated by LeOrbis)
===============================================================================

**Purpose:**  
A science-backed, real-world protocol for supporting healthy tissue, joint stability, and energy in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and related connective tissue conditions, using ONLY widely available over-the-counter supplements. No prescription or IV ingredients included below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Core Components & Why They Matter**
(Recommended brands: reputable, third-party tested, hypoallergenic when possible)

- **Methylcobalamin (B12, sublingual):** For nerve repair, energy, DNA repair, absorption issues
- **P5P (B6, as pyridoxal-5-phosphate):** For neurotransmitters, healing, collagen crosslinking
- **Methylfolate (L-5-MTHF):** For DNA synthesis and repair, energy, safe even with MTHFR variant
- **Vitamin C (ascorbic acid):** Required for collagen synthesis, wound healing, immune function
- **Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol):** For bone, muscle, immune, supports calcium absorption
- **Magnesium glycinate/citrate:** For muscle/nerve function, energy, headache, pain, constipation
- **Zinc picolinate or gluconate:** For collagen repair, immunity; keep doses safe and balance with copper
- **Copper gluconate (LOW dose):** Synergy with zinc and collagen crosslinks, but keep mild (e.g., 1mg)
- **Iron bisglycinate/sulfate (if low):** For anemia, energy, healing (only if diagnosed; check ferritin)
- **Orthosilicic acid (BioSil or similar):** For matrix strength, tendon/bone/skin health
- **Marine or chicken collagen peptides (hydrolyzed powder):** Most absorbable for joint, skin, gut repair
- **Hyaluronic acid oral:** For joint lubrication, skin/tissue hydration

**Dosage/Use:**  
- Use label dosing, titrate up SLOWLY, and always coordinate with your provider.
- For collagen peptides, 5–10g/day in divided doses is typical; mix in drinks, smoothies, or soups.
- Do not “stack” high-dose copper, iron, or zinc unless labs confirm deficiency.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Safety Tips & Warnings**
- Always consult your doctor, specialist, or pharmacist before starting or combining supplements.
- Start low and add supplements ONE AT A TIME to watch for allergies or side effects.
- If you notice severe side effects, new or worsening symptoms, or allergic reactions, discontinue and consult a provider.
- Consider baseline labs (CBC, ferritin, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, copper) and retest periodically.

**NOT FOR IV USE.** This OTC protocol is intended as an adjunct to—not a replacement for—medical advice, prescription therapy, or emergency care.

*For anyone wanting faster or more effective results: track your symptoms/side effects in a log and bring your full supplement list to every doctor’s appointment for review!*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Why This May Help**
- These nutrients directly address the most common deficiencies and repair obstacles in EDS (and many other rare or chronic fatigue conditions).
- Multi-source collagen, robust cofactor support, and titration with careful symptom tracking is supported by both clinical research and patient experience.
