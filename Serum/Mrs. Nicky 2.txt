MOLD TOXICITY SUPPORT PROTOCOL — HOME-INSPIRED, OTC, NON-PRESCRIPTION VERSION
Adapted for vEDS, MCAS, Autoimmunity, and Sensitive/Bedbound Patients
Prepared by LeOrbis | v1.0 | For Patient/Provider/Family Review
===============================================================================

PURPOSE:
--------
Support gentle, sustainable recovery from chronic mold exposure using safe, OTC, functional medicine strategies. All recommendations should be discussed with a healthcare provider before starting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENTAL FIRST AID (ALWAYS #1)
------------------------------------
• Remove source: Fix leaks, dry out rooms, use dehumidifier/heavy-duty ventilation, professional remediation if possible.
• Use HEPA air purifier (bedroom/living area)—run 24/7 if affordable.
• Clean air/ducts with HEPA vacuum and simple soap (NO harsh scents or bleach on porous surfaces).
• Change HVAC/furnace filters frequently; use high MERV rating.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NUTRITION & DIET
-----------------
• Avoid processed foods, fast foods, and “leftovers” (high mold/spore load).
• Low-histamine, anti-inflammatory diet if tolerated: Lean meats, fresh fruits, certain vegetables (cooked, not raw leafy greens), healthy fats (olive/coconut oil), gluten-free grains.
• Increase fluid intake: Water, lemon water, “safe” herbal teas (e.g., ginger, peppermint) to support detox and hydration.
• Add clean protein for tissue repair.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BINDER STRATEGY (OTC, WITH DOCTOR APPROVAL)
-------------------------------------------
• **Activated charcoal:** Start with 250–500mg once daily, away from meds/supps by 2+ hours. Slowly titrate up as tolerated.
• **Bentonite clay or chlorella/spirulina:** (Alternative binders, 500–1000mg once daily, with lots of water)
• **Psyllium husk:** May help “carry out” toxins, improve gut motility.
• **Vitamin C:** 500–1000mg, twice daily—supports tissue repair, may help neutralize certain mycotoxins.
• **Magnesium glycinate/citrate:** 200–400mg at bedtime to aid cellular energy and reduce headaches/cramping.

*Monitor for constipation with binders—adjust dose/hydration as needed.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYMPOM TRACKING & GENTLE DETOX SUPPORT
--------------------------------------
• Keep a daily log: Fatigue, joint/muscle pain, brain fog, rashes, bowel/mood changes, sleep quality.
• Add “symptom score” (1–10) before and after new steps.
• Slow increases are best—don’t add more than one new aid per 3–5 days.
• Avoid major sauna/sweating routines without medical consult if bedbound.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALLERGY & SENSITIVITY MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------
• For MCAS/EDS: Take all new supplements with caution; only hypoallergenic, additive-free products.
• If new rash, swelling, wheeze, or severe GI reaction—STOP and seek care. Add details to tracker.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAFETY AND COMMUNICATION
-------------------------
• All recommendations meant as *support*, not cure.
• Never stop prescribed medicines without consulting doctor.
• Report all new or severe symptoms (tingling, numbing, chest pain, breathing issues, hallucinations, high fever) immediately.
